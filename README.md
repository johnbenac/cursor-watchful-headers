# File Watcher with Header Management

A Python-based file watching system that automatically manages headers in text files and maintains a project tree structure. Perfect for maintaining consistent file headers and documentation across your project.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/johnbenac/cursor-watchful-headers.git
   ```

2. Run the installation script:
   ```bash
   python cursor-watchful-headers/install.py
   ```
   This will:
   - Copy `watcher.py` and `watchlist` to your current directory (if they don't already exist)
   - Install the required dependencies

3. Start the watcher:
   ```bash
   python watcher.py
   ```

## Example Tree and File Headers

When you run the watcher, it automatically generates file headers that include the current project tree structure. For example, a portion of the generated **.cursorrules** file may look like:

```
# === WATCHER HEADER START ===
# File: .cursorrules
# Managed by file watcher
# Project Tree Structure:
#
# â”œâ”€â”€ .cursorrules
# â”œâ”€â”€ .specstory
# â”‚   â””â”€â”€ history
# â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ .what-is-this.md
# â”‚       â””â”€â”€ creating-fruit-themed-text-files.md
# â”œâ”€â”€ foods
# â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ beverages
# â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ juice.txt
# â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ smoothie.txt
# â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tea.txt
# â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dairy
# â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cheese.txt
# â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ milk.txt
# â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ yogurt.txt
# â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ fruits
# â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ apple.txt
# â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ banana.txt
# â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ orange.txt
# â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ grains
# â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ bread.txt
# â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pasta.txt
# â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ rice.txt
# â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ snacks
# â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ chips.txt
# â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ nuts.txt
# â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ popcorn.txt
# â”‚   â””â”€â”€ vegetables
# â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ broccoli.txt
# â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ carrot.txt
# â”‚       â””â”€â”€ spinach.txt
# â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
# â”œâ”€â”€ tests
# â”œâ”€â”€ watcher.py
# â””â”€â”€ watchlist
# === WATCHER HEADER END ===
```

Similarly, individual files receive headers. For example, the header in **foods/vegetables/carrot.txt** might be:

```
# === WATCHER HEADER START ===
# File: foods/vegetables/carrot.txt
# Managed by file watcher
# === WATCHER HEADER END ===
Crunchy orange carrot, straight from the ground! ðŸ¥•
Rich in vitamin A, making your eyesight sound!
```

### How This Helps LLMs

Long conversations or complex projects can cause the context of file paths and project structure to become obscured. By including explicit header information that shows each file's location within the overall project tree, both developers and LLM-based coding assistants are provided with clear context. This mitigates common issues such as:

- Duplicating files by forgetting existing entries
- Losing track of how individual files relate to the larger codebase
- Overlooking important structural context during long modification sessions

This way, when an LLM is assisting with code modifications, it can reference the file's placement and relationships, ensuring consistent and context-aware modifications even when conversation history becomes very lengthy.

## Features

- Automatically adds and updates headers in watched files
- Maintains a live project tree structure in `.cursorrules`
- Supports multiple file types with appropriate comment syntax
- Dynamic watching of new files and directories
- Debounced file updates to prevent excessive writes
- Thread-safe header management

## Example Data

This repository includes example food-themed content to demonstrate the watcher's functionality. When integrating into your own project:

1. You can safely remove the `foods/` directory and its contents
2. The example structure shows how the watcher handles:
   - Multiple directory levels
   - Different file types
   - Various comment syntaxes
   - Real-time updates

## Using in Your Project

### Option 1: Installing via Script (Recommended)

If you want to add the watcher to an existing project:

1. From your project root, clone and install:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/johnbenac/cursor-watchful-headers.git
   python cursor-watchful-headers/install.py
   ```

2. The script will:
   - Copy `watcher.py` and `watchlist` to your current directory (if they don't already exist)
   - Install the required `watchdog` package
   - Leave your existing `requirements.txt` untouched
   - Leave your existing `.cursorrules` untouched (at least until you run watcher.py)

3. You can now delete the cloned directory if desired (the copied files in your current directory will remain):
   ```bash
   rm -rf cursor-watchful-headers  # On Windows: rmdir /s /q cursor-watchful-headers
   ```

### Option 2: Manual Installation

If you prefer to set things up manually:

1. Copy these essential files to your project root:
   ```
   watcher.py
   watchlist
   ```

2. Install the required dependency:
   ```bash
   pip install watchdog==3.0.0
   ```

3. Create or modify your `watchlist` file:
   ```
   # watchlist
   # Add your project files to watch (one per line)
   src/components/header.js
   src/utils/helpers.py
   docs/api.md
   # etc...
   ```

4. Start the watcher:
   ```bash
   python watcher.py
   ```

**Note:** The `.cursorrules` file will be automatically created in your project root when you first run the watcher.

## Usage

1. Add files to watch in `watchlist`:
   ```
   # One file per line
   path/to/your/file.txt
   ```

2. Run the watcher:
   ```bash
   python watcher.py
   ```

3. The watcher will:
   - Add headers to all watched files
   - Update `.cursorrules` with the project tree
   - Monitor for changes in real-time
   - Automatically watch new files added to the watchlist

## File Headers

Headers are automatically added to watched files in the appropriate comment syntax:
```
# === WATCHER HEADER START ===
# File: path/to/file.txt
# Managed by file watcher
# === WATCHER HEADER END ===
```

## Supported File Types

- Python (.py)
- JavaScript (.js)
- HTML (.html)
- XML (.xml)
- CSS (.css)
- Text (.txt)
- Markdown (.md)
- Java (.java)
- C++ (.cpp)
- C (.c)
- Shell scripts (.sh)

## Configuration

### Adding New File Types

Edit `COMMENT_SYNTAX` in `watcher.py` to add support for more file types:
```python
COMMENT_SYNTAX = {
    '.py': {'start': '# ', 'end': ''},
    '.js': {'start': '// ', 'end': ''},
    # Add your custom file types:
    '.xyz': {'start': '/* ', 'end': ' */'},
}
```

### Performance Tuning

- Modify `time.sleep(0.1)` in the main loop to adjust check frequency
- Adjust debounce time (default 1.0s) in `update_file_header`
- The `.cursorrules` file is automatically maintained with the project structure

## Best Practices

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Start with a small set of files in your watchlist
   - Verify header format meets your needs
   - Add more files progressively

2. **Directory Structure**:
   - Keep watched files within your project root
   - Use relative paths in watchlist
   - Group related files in directories
